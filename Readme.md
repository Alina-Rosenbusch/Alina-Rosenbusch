Hello to everyone who got washed up to my first experimental chaotic try of using this tool 

### About myself 
I'm a young woman in nothern germany jsut learing this new tool and programming in general. Originally, I was more into cultural studies, but I wasn't entirely happy there anymore and left for new shores. And now I'm here for new interessting thing to learn. 

And here just a little picture for heartwarming moment:

And some things I really enjoy doing: 
- spending time with friends 
- singing 
- being outside in the sun 
- going for a run
